            <p className="fw-bold">The Sport Club Program at Dickinson College is comprised of sport clubs formed, developed, governed,
                and administered by the student membership working in conjunction with the Office of Intramurals and
                Recreation, a unit of the Division of Student Life.  The key to the success of this program is student
                leadership, interest, involvement, and participation.
                The Sport Club Council with advisement of the Office of Intramurals and Recreation has created this
                manual in order to provide officers with the structural framework necessary for clubs to gain
                recognition, develop leadership skills, and run safe, efficient programs.  The policies and procedures
                contained herein apply to all of the clubs. Sport club members, officers, coaches, and the faculty/staff
                advisor are required to read, understand, and follow the procedures outlined in this manual.</p>
